# Microservice POC

This repository is a proof of concept for microservices in docker, using both .Net and Node-services.
We are using [Ocelot](http://threemammals.com/ocelot) to route requests to the correct service, so the only port we expose from our docker-environment is port 5000 for Ocelot.

Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/Arthyon/microservice-poc/wiki) for tips on getting started, developing, debugging etc.
